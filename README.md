This simple annotation processor allows you to transform calls like this:

```java
System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir");
```

into calls like this:

```java
System.getProperty(java.io.tmpdir);
```

**TreeConstants** turns each string constant into a field of a class hierarchy. For the `"java.io.tmpdir"` example, the annotation processor creates two nested classes (`java`, `io`) and a field (`tmpdir`). Your code can then use `java.io.tmpdir` exactly as `"java.io.tmpdir"` without caring where the class hierarchy actually resides. Since `javac` automatically inlines `static final` fields, there's zero runtime performance impact from using **TreeConstants**. To prove the point, the classes generated by the annotation processor don't even need to be included in your artifacts since they will never be loaded anyway.

Here are some advantages of using **TreeConstants**:
- Compile-time typo detection
- Autocompletion and documentation support within IDEs
- Allows more powerful refactoring operations than find-and-replace

Here are some disadvantages of using **TreeConstants**:
- Eclipse doesn't fully support Gradle annotation processors yet (apply `net.ltgt.apt-eclipse` plugin in the meantime)

#### Custom Constant Trees
`java.io.tmpdir` was just an illustrative example. The real utility of **TreeConstants** is defining your own constant trees:

```java
@TreeConstant
private static final String ui_view_main = "ui.view.main";

@TreeConstant
private static final int permission_read = 102;
```

This example shows that any `static final` field can become a tree constant. The underscore-separated name of the field determines the tree structure (so `ui_view_main` will become `ui.view.main`). The field's value is the key that will replace references to the tree constant in code.

#### Gradle Usage
To include **TreeConstants** in a Gradle project, add the following dependencies to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
compileOnly 'com.github.cilki:tree-constants-api:1.0.0'
annotationProcessor 'com.github.cilki:tree-constants:1.0.0'
```

Or if you just want a set of standard tree constants for the JDK:

```groovy
compileOnly 'com.github.cilki:tree-constants-common:1.0.0'
```
